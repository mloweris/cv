abstract = {REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: To improve osteochondral graft reconstruction of subchondral cystic lesions in the medial and lateral femoral condyles by matching the material properties of donor and recipient sites. OBJECTIVES: To measure biomechanical and biochemical parameters that influence the function and healing of osteochondral grafts used to reconstruct subchondral cystic lesions. HYPOTHESIS: Suitable donor sites are available within the stifle joint for reconstructing the femoral condyles, despite considerable regional property variation. METHODS: Fifty-six osteochondral cores were harvested from 6 distal femurs for initial studies that determined subchondral bone modulus of elasticity and ultimate stress. In a second study, 28 osteochondral cores were harvested from 6 distal femurs to measure cartilage aggregate modulus, thickness and sulphated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) content. Using micro-CT imaging, subchondral bone mineral density and bone volume fraction were also measured. In both studies 2-dimensional contour plots using a bicubic interpolation method and normalised data were generated to allow visual comparison of joint surface characteristics. Statistical comparisons between donor and recipient site raw data were made using an ANOVA for repeated measures with a post hoc Tukey test. RESULTS: Material properties of cartilage and bone vary considerably over the surface of the stifle joint but the central region of the medial condyle, where subchondral cystic lesions freqdently occur, typically demonstrated bone strength and modulus values of the highest observed. Cartilage thickness and aggregate modulus were highest in the medial femoral condyle and axial aspect of the lateral condyle. CONCLUSIONS: Material properties of the grafts from the trochlear groove and axial aspect of the lateral trochlear ridge were the closest match for those found in the medial condyle, whereas properties of the lateral condyle were most similar to those found in the trochlear groove and axial aspect of the medial trochlear ridge.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine characteristics, incidence rate, and possible associations with selected demographic characteristics of catastrophic musculoskeletal injuries (CMIs) in Thoroughbred racehorses. ANIMALS: 76 Thoroughbreds with CMIs. PROCEDURES: Incidence rates of CMIs during racing or training were calculated with number of CMIs as the numerator and overall numbers of races or training events during 2004 and 2005 as the denominators. Exact 95\% confidence intervals were calculated. Associations between incidence and dichotomous exposure factors, nominal factors, and ordinal factors were determined. Only univariable associations were examined. RESULTS: 76 horses were euthanized because of CMI and represented 2.36 and 1.69 deaths/1,000 racing starts in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Of these, 57 were euthanized within 60 days before or after a race, which yielded a point incidence of 1.05/1,000 racing starts and 0.39/1,000 training starts. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Incidence rate of CMIs at 2 Ontario racetracks was similar to that at other North American racetracks. A cumulative death rate of 1 to 2 deaths/wk should be considered typical when designing prevention strategies and offers a baseline value for measuring improvement.},

MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched, using terms specific to Tourette syndrome and tic disorders, for studies of incidence, prevalence, and epidemiology. Thirty-five studies reporting data from 1985-2011 on the incidence or prevalence of tic disorders in a defined population were included. One reported incidence, and 34 reported prevalence. Meta-analysis of 13 studies of children yielded a prevalence of Tourette syndrome at 0.77\% (95\% confidence interval, 0.39-1.51\%). Prevalence is higher in boys: 1.06\% of boys were affected (95\% confidence interval, 0.54-2.09\%) vs 0.25\% of girls (95\% confidence interval, 0.05-1.20\%). Transient tic disorder comprised the most common tic disorder in children, affecting 2.99\% (95\% confidence interval, 1.60-5.61\%). Meta-analysis of two studies assessing adults for Tourette syndrome revealed a prevalence of 0.05\% (95\% confidence interval, 0.03-0.08\%). The prevalence of tic disorders was higher in all studies performed in special education populations. Tic disorders are more common in children than adults, in boys than girls, and in special education populations. Parents, educators, healthcare professionals, and administrators should be aware of the frequency with which tic disorders occur, and ensure proper access to appropriate care.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Response shift (RS) is an important phenomenon that influences the assessment of longitudinal changes in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) studies. Given that RS effects are often small, missing data due to attrition or item non-response can contribute to failure to detect RS effects. Since missing data are often encountered in longitudinal HRQOL data, effective strategies to deal with missing data are important to consider. This study aims to compare different imputation methods on the detection of reprioritization RS in the HRQOL of caregivers of stroke survivors. METHODS: Data were from a Canadian multi-center longitudinal study of caregivers of stroke survivors over a one-year period. The Stroke Impact Scale physical function score at baseline, with a cutoff of 75, was used to measure patient stroke severity for the reprioritization RS analysis. Mean imputation, likelihood-based expectation-maximization imputation, and multiple imputation methods were compared in test procedures based on changes in relative importance weights to detect RS in SF-36 domains over a 6-month period. Monte Carlo simulation methods were used to compare the statistical powers of relative importance test procedures for detecting RS in incomplete longitudinal data under different missing data mechanisms and imputation methods. RESULTS: Of the 409 caregivers, 15.9 and 31.3 \% of them had missing data at baseline and 6 months, respectively. There were no statistically significant changes in relative importance weights on any of the domains when complete-case analysis was adopted. But statistical significant changes were detected on physical functioning and/or vitality domains when mean imputation or EM imputation was adopted. There were also statistically significant changes in relative importance weights for physical functioning, mental health, and vitality domains when multiple imputation method was adopted. Our simulations revealed that relative importance test procedures were least powerful under complete-case analysis method and most powerful when a mean imputation or multiple imputation method was adopted for missing data, regardless of the missing data mechanism and proportion of missing data. CONCLUSIONS: Test procedures based on relative importance measures are sensitive to the type and amount of missing data and imputation method. Relative importance test procedures based on mean imputation and multiple imputation are recommended for detecting RS in incomplete data.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: This study investigated whether inducing central sensitization evokes segmental increases in trigger point pressure sensitivity. We evoked central sensitization at the C(5) segment and validated its presence via mechanical cutaneous sensitivity (brush allodynia) testing. Trigger point pressure sensitivity was quantified using the pain pressure threshold (PPT) value. A 50 cm(2) area of the C(5) dermatome at the right lateral elbow was pretreated with 45 degrees heat for 10 minutes. Test subjects (n = 20) then received topical capsaicin cream (0.075\%; Medicis, Toronto, Canada) to the C(5) dermatome, whereas control subjects (n = 20) received a topical placebo cream (Biotherm Massage, Montreal, Canada). PPT readings were recorded from the infraspinatus (C(5,6)) and gluteus medius (L(4,5)S(1)) trigger points at zero (pre-intervention), 10, 20, and 30 minutes after intervention; all PPT readings were normalized to pre-intervention (baseline) values. The difference between the PPT readings at the 2 trigger point sites represents the direct influence of segmental mechanisms on the trigger point sensitivity at the infraspinatus site (PPT(seg)). Test subjects demonstrated statistically significant increases in Total Allodynia scores and significant decreases in PPT(seg) at 10, 20, and 30 minutes after application, when compared with control subjects. These results demonstrate that increases in central sensitization evoke increases in trigger point pressure sensitivity in segmentally related muscles. PERSPECTIVE: Myofascial pain is the most common form of musculoskeletal pain. Myofascial trigger points play an important role in the clinical manifestation of myofascial pain syndrome. Elucidating the role of central sensitization in the pathophysiology of trigger points is fundamental to developing optimal strategies in the management of myofascial pain syndrome.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that dry needle stimulation of a myofascial trigger point (sensitive locus) evokes segmental anti-nociceptive effects. DESIGN: Double-blind randomized controlled trial. SUBJECTS: Forty subjects (21 males, 19 females). METHODS: Test subjects received intramuscular dry needle puncture to a right supraspinatus trigger point (C4,5); controls received sham intramuscular dry needle puncture. Pain pressure threshold (PPT) readings were recorded from right infraspinatus (C5,6) and right gluteus medius (L4,5S1) trigger points at 0 (pre-needling baseline), 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 min post-needling and normalized to baseline values. The supraspinatus and infraspinatus trigger points are neurologically linked at C5; the supraspinatus and gluteus medius are segmentally unrelated. The difference between the infraspinatus and gluteus medius PPT values (PPTseg) represents a direct measure of the segmental anti-nociceptive effects acting at the infraspinatus trigger point. RESULTS: Significant increases in PPTseg were observed in test subjects at 3 (p = 0.002) and 5 (p = 0.015) min post-needling, compared with controls. CONCLUSION: One intervention of dry needle stimulation to a single trigger point (sensitive locus) evokes short-term segmental anti-nociceptive effects. These results suggest that trigger point (sensitive locus) stimulation may evoke anti-nociceptive effects by modulating segmental mechanisms, which may be an important consideration in the management of myofascial pain.},

abstract = {Musculoskeletal pain affects a significant proportion of the general population. The myofascial trigger point is recognized as a key factor in the pathophysiology of musculoskeletal pain. Ultrasound is commonly employed in the treatment and management of soft tissue pain and, in this study, we set out to investigate the segmental antinociceptive effect of ultrasound. Subjects (n=50) with identifiable myofascial trigger points in the supraspinatus, infraspinatus and gluteus medius muscles were selected from an outpatient rehabilitation clinic and randomly assigned to test or control groups. Test subjects received a therapeutic dose of ultrasound to the right supraspinatus trigger point while control groups received a sham (null) exposure. Baseline pain pressure threshold (PPT) readings were recorded at the ipsilateral infraspinatus and gluteus medius trigger-point sites prior to ultrasound exposure. The infraspinatus point was chosen due to its segmental neurologic link with the supraspinatus point; the gluteus medius acted as a segmental control point. Following the ultrasound intervention, PPT readings were recorded at 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 min intervals at both infraspinatus and gluteus medius trigger points; the difference between infraspinatus and gluteus medius PPT values, PPT seg, represents the segmental influence on the PPT. The ultrasound test group demonstrated statistically significant increases in PPT seg (decreased infraspinatus sensitivity) at 1, 3 and 5 min, when compared with PPT seg in the sham ultrasound group. These results establish that low-dose ultrasound evokes short-term segmental antinociceptive effects on trigger points which may have applications in the management of musculoskeletal pain.},

abstract = {Rumen development in calves has been evaluated by measuring papillae length, width, and density using microscopy for over 50 yr. Although common in the literature, disadvantages to this method exist, such as large variations in rumen papillae size and shape, small numbers of total papillae being measured, and the time required. The objective of this study was to develop a more effective technique for assessing rumen papillae using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and to compare this technique with microscopy. Rumen tissue was collected from the ventral sac of 20 postweaned bull calves at 55 d of age, immediately fixed in 10\% neutral buffered formalin for 48 h, and stored in 70\% ethanol at 4°C before the contrast enhancement. After evaluation of contrast-enhancement protocols, it was determined that mercury chloride provided the most pronounced contrast for accurate micro-CT imaging based on relative density of the papillae. A 1-cm(2) tissue section from the ventral sac of all bull calves was tensioned on a rapid prototyped curved plastic holder and imaged at 4 5 $\mu$m resolution for 56 min using a GE Locus Explore micro-CT (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI). MicroView V2.2 software (General Electric) was used to create a 3-dimensional virtual model of the entire sample. The length and width of papillae were measured 3-dimensionally and compared with measurements of papillae under the light microscope taken from the same region. The length and width measurements using micro-CT (2.47 ± 0.12 and 0.55 ± 0.01 mm) compared with light microscope (2.96 ± 0.03 and 0.86 ± 0.01 mm) were significantly smaller. The difference may reflect a more accurate determination in the base of the rumen tissue with micro-CT or the specificity of mercury chloride to bind only to intact rumen tissue. The mean number of papillae per centimeter squared viewed using micro-CT was 128.5 ± 33.9 with a total surface area of 681.8 ± 112.4 mm(2) and volume of 156 mm(3) per sample. Micro-CT data demonstrated that surface area and volume are positively associated and that papillae length was negatively associated with papillae per centimeter squared and positively associated with total volume of tissue section. This study represents the first time that micro-CT has been being used to assess morphology of rumen tissue. Micro-CT has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of rumen tissue measurements; however, more standardization of each factor involved in tissue preparation, imaging, and location of papillae measurements is required.},
